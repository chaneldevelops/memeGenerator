The Memes Generator is built using the following methods:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient component-based development, enabling a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **React Hooks:** Leveraging the power of `useState`, this project uses React Hooks to manage state within functional components. The state allows for dynamic updates and ensures a responsive interface.
- **Event Listeners:** By utilizing event listeners, the Memes Generator captures user input and triggers actions, such as updating the meme text and fetching random meme images.
- **Conditional Rendering:** The application employs conditional rendering techniques to display different components based on the state, enabling a dynamic and intuitive user interface.
- **Side Effects (useEffect):** The `useEffect` hook is used to handle side effects, such as fetching meme data from an external API. It ensures that the necessary actions are performed when specific conditions are met.
